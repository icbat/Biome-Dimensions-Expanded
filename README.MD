Biome Dimensions Expanded
=========================

This Fabric mod adds 14 new dimensions that are similar to the overworld, but each contain only a small number of biomes.

Great for playing in a relatively small worldborder, but still getting some variety.

## Portals

Each new portal type works the same as Nether portals, but use a different block other than Obsidian. Blocks currently supported are:

- Sandstone
- Chiseled Sandstone
- Red Mushroom Blocks
- Stripped Bamboo
- Stripped Mangrove Logs
- Stripped Birch Logs
- Stripped Dark Oak Logs
- Stripped Cherry Logs
- Stripped Acacia Logs
- Stripped Jungle Logs
- Snow Blocks
- Ice
- Packed Ice
- Blue Ice

## Dimensional Factoids

The dimensions follow the same rules as the overworld, and distance there is 1:1 with the overworld.

Dimensions currently use the LargeBiome noise generation presets, and as such, will all have the same features.
